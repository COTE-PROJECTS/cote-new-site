                            Uganda boasts a young and vibrant population, with 78% under 30 years. However, a critical gap exists â€“ a lack of practical IT skills needed to succeed in the digital age. The global pandemic accelerated the shift towards a digital world, and by 2030, millions of jobs in Africa will require these skills.

                            In 2020, the surge in remote work due to the global pandemic exposed a critical challenge: a vast lack of digital skills among young Africans. This gap hinders not just individual employability, but also Africa's immense potential for innovation and economic growth.

                            This is where COTE Technologies (Center Of Technology Evolution) steps in. We were born from a vision to address this very need. We believe that equipping young people with practical IT skills is the key to unlocking their potential and propelling Africa's future.
